            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>I am a sophmore at Kennesaw State University studying Information Technology. I am currently working 3 jobs which include Retail Sales Representative at T-Mobile, Area Supervisor at Truett's Grill Chick-Fil-A, and Catering Delivery Contractor at Fooda. I am very interested in the Health IT field and want to learn more about it. I am a hard worker, adaptable to most situations, and a leader in the workspace. My goal is to work in a Health IT company that can help me foster a career in the field!<p>
            <p> In regards to my personal life, I love to explore the latest smartphone tech, learning all about the devices, OS, and build of the phone. I enjoy playing videogames such as Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, and various couch-play fighting games. I also love spending time with loved ones and friends, including my pets! Being outdoors is especially amazing as it allows me to relax and take in the world around me in a vast, bright space. <p>
                <p>To elabroate on my perosnal and professional goals, I plan to go into Health IT and start a family with my boyfriend. I want to achieve financial stability in my life more than anything. Progressing into my later life, I want to look back on my life and be able to say it was well lived. </p>
